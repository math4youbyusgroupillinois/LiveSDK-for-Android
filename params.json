Introduction\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe Live SDK for Android library is intended to help developers to easily \r\nintegrate OneDrive and Outlook.com contacts into their Android apps.\r\n\r\nFor questions on how to use the sdk visit http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/onedrive\r\n\r\n2. Reference the API\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nAfter you download the Android API source code, you must compile it. You need\r\nto do this only once. After you compile the Android API source code on your\r\ncomputer, you can reference it from multiple Eclipse Android projects on that\r\nsame computer.\r\n\r\nTo compile the Android API source code  \r\n* Start Eclipse, if it is not already running.\r\n* Click File > Import.\r\n* Expand General, click Existing Projects into Workspace, and then click Next.\r\n* With the Select root directory option selected, click Browse.\r\n* Go to and select the src folder within the downloaded Live SDK for Android, and then click OK.\r\n* In the Projects box, select the LiveSdk check box.\r\n* With the Copy projects into workspace check box selected, click Finish.\r\n  Eclipse adds the LiveSdk project to the Package Explorer pane and then\r\n  compiles the Android API source code in the background.\r\n* You can now reference the compiled Android API source code from your Eclipse\r\n  Android projects.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo reference the compiled Android API source code in an Eclipse Android\r\nproject\r\n* In Eclipse, display the Package Explorer pane, if it is not already visible.\r\n* Right-click your project's name, and then click Properties.\r\n* In the list of project properties, click Android.\r\n* In the Library area, click Add.\r\n* Click LiveSdk and then click OK.\r\n* Click OK. Eclipse sets a reference to the compiled Android API source code\r\n  project, and you can now call the Live Connect Android API from your own\r\n  Android project.\r\n\r\nNote: Before you run your project, you must add the Internet permission to your\r\n      project's manifest, as shown in the following steps. If you don't add the\r\n      Internet permission, your app may have problems accessing Live Connect\r\n      web services later.\r\n* With your project open, in the Package Explorer pane, open the AndroidManifest.xml file.\r\n* In the editor, click the Permissions tab.\r\n* Click Add.\r\n* Click Uses Permission, and then click OK.\r\n* the Name list, click android.permission.INTERNET.\r\n* Save the AndroidManifest.xml file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Java Compiler must be version 1.6 or higher.\r\n\r\n3. Documentation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nVisit: http://dev.onedrive.com and click the \"Documentation\" link. \r\n\r\n4. Sample project\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThere is a sample project located in the sample directory. Using eclipse this project can be added\r\nusing the File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace wizard. Before the project can be\r\nproperly used, the static variable com.microsoft.live.sample.Config.CLIENT_ID (see Config.java) must\r\nbe changed to your own client ID. To obtain a Client ID, visit the [Live SDK App management page] (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=193157)\r\n\r\n5. Known issues:\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1) Login dialog is destroyed on screen rotation if the Activity is not set to\r\n   ignore orientation changes in AndroidManifest.xml.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense Agreement\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Microsoft Corporation\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
